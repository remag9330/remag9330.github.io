It's only fitting that the first post be what you'd expect to see on this blog, except that I'm not really sure what I'll really use this for.

- Just as a way to shout into the void
- Something I just need to get off my chest
- Type out random thoughts/ideas/opinions

No idea.

But I do know that I don't really expect anyone to read it. I think it's mostly a place for me to do what I want with it. I likely won't post it anywhere. In fact, it's probably more just a place I can play around with ideas for a blog generator tool.

Yeah yeah, I know. I'm a software developer.

Chances are I'll just drop this side project like I do with most of my other ones in a couple weeks. The hope is maybe if I do dogfood it, I'll stick with it a bit more.

In saying that, I do have a few goals in mind for it:

1. Simple and clean

This mostly refers to the actual HTML of the output posts. No JS, minimal CSS; that sort of thing.

2. Fully automated

Or at most, run a single command to update all blog posts based on the templates/`content.md`s/etc.

3. Blazingly fast
