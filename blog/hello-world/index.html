    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <p>It's only fitting that the first post be what you'd expect to see on this blog, except that I'm not really sure what I'll really use this for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as a way to shout into the void</li>
<li>Something I just need to get off my chest</li>
<li>Type out random thoughts/ideas/opinions</li>
</ul>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>But I do know that I don't really expect anyone to read it. I think it's mostly a place for me to do what I want with it. I likely won't post it anywhere. In fact, it's probably more just a place I can play around with ideas for a blog generator tool.</p>

<p>Help, police - He's re-inventing the wheel!</p>

<p>Yeah yeah, I know. I'm a software developer.</p>
<p>Chances are I'll just drop this side project like I do with most of my other ones in a couple weeks. The hope is maybe if I do dogfood it, I'll stick with it a bit more.</p>
<p>In saying that, I do have a few goals in mind for it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple and clean</li>
</ol>
<p>This mostly refers to the actual HTML of the output posts. No JS, minimal CSS; that sort of thing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Fully automated</li>
</ol>
<p>Or at most, run a single command to update all blog posts based on the templates/<code>content.md</code>s/etc.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Blazingly fast</li>
</ol>
<p>üòè üòè üòè</p>
<p>But seriously, I think rust is fun enough to use, and experience spread out over many things can only be good for my skillset anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah hopefully I can keep this up maybe for a longer time than my other projects, but I guess we'll see.</p>
